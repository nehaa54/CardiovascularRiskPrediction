# CardiovascularRiskPrediction
PROJECT SUMMARY-Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 18.6 million lives each year, which accounts for 33% of all the global deaths. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

It is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin.

Our main aim here is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

The problem and aim stated above can be solved with the help of machine learning models and the data that we have. The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

Variables - Each attribute is a potential risk factor. These attributes include demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.
